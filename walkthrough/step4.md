# Unlock Specialized Capabilities with MCP

**The Model Context Protocol (MCP) connects Cline Local to a world of powerful tools.**

Go beyond local code. With the Model Context Protocol (MCP), Cline Local can access context and tools from external sources you configure (databases, APIs, internal services). This fork does not include an in-app marketplace; instead, add MCP servers manually and control exactly what capabilities are available. All tool calls require your approval.
