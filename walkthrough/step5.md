# No Black Box: Full Visibility & Control

**Cline operates with complete transparency, showing you every file read and every proposed diff.**

Understand exactly what Cline is doing and whyâ€”no obfuscation. Review all actions and approve changes before they're made. Cline Local does not create background checkpoints; use your Git repository for diffs and rollbacks. Terminal commands are gated by approval. With local providers or self-hosted endpoints, you maintain full control.
